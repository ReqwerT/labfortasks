|1|I can't assign a static IP to my Debian virtual machine with Preseed. | Even though I disabled DHCP in Preseed and configured a static IP address, my VM automatically assigned an IP address via DHCP every time. This caused me to have trouble accessing it from Ansible. | I solved the problem by assigning an IP address with extra-args in the virtual machine properties in the auto_debian_insall.sh file. This allowed me to set my IP address to dot.10. | ✅ | 04.07.2025 |
|2|GRUB operating system detection error | When I automatically pull the default network from the system and then type `vagrant destroy -f`, it removes the default network configuration from the system. | I solved the problem by assigning an IP address with extra-args in the virtual machine properties in the auto_debian_insall.sh file. This allowed me to set my IP address to dot.10. | ✅ | 04.07.2025 |
|3| When I type `vagrant destroy`, the default network is deleted. | When I automatically pull the default network from the system and then type `vagrant destroy -f`, it removes the default network configuration from the system. | As a solution, I created a `before up` trigger and made the default network undeletable with the `chattr +i` command in this trigger. | ✅ | 14.07.2025 |
