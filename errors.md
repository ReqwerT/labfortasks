|1|I can't assign a `Static IP` to my Debian virtual machine with Preseed. | Even though I disabled DHCP in Preseed and configured a static IP address, my VM automatically assigned an IP address via DHCP every time. This caused me to have trouble accessing it from Ansible. | I solved the problem by assigning an IP address with `extra-args` in the virtual machine properties in the `auto_debian_insall.sh` file. This allowed me to set my IP address to `dot.10`. | ✅ | 04.07.2025 |
|2|`GRUB` operating system detection error | When I installed GRUB via my preseed file, it only identified the Debian operating system and automatically booted from the Debian operating system before the selection screen appeared. | In my preseed file, I prevented Debian from automatically booting by setting the `only_debian boolean` value to false in the grub configuration. I also enabled it to detect other operating systems by setting the `with_other_os` boolean value to true. This way, it automatically detects other operating systems at every startup and doesn't boot directly from Debian. | ✅ | 04.07.2025 |
|3| When I type `vagrant destroy`, the default network is deleted. | When I automatically pull the default network from the system and then type `vagrant destroy -f`, it removes the default network configuration from the system. | As a workaround, I first tried making the default network undeletable using `chattr +i` with the `"trigger.before :up"` trigger. This worked, but it wasn't an effective solution. So, thinking the fault was on my side, I continued my research and, in the IP configurations, `libvirt__network_name: "default"`, `libvirt__always_destroy: false` With the two parameters above, I first selected the network I wanted to use as the `default`. Then, to prevent the network from being deleted, I set the `libvirt__always_destroy` parameter to `false`. This value is set to true by default with Vagrant. If a network isn't being used by another virtual machine, this parameter allows Vagrant to delete it, even if it wasn't created by Vagrant. After changing these two values, my problem was resolved, and when I typed vagrant destroy -f, the network wasn't deleted. | ✅ | 14.07.2025 |
