|ID| ERROR | DESCRIPTION | APPLIED SOLUTION | IS SOLVED? | DATE |

|1|I can't assign a static IP to my Debian virtual machine with Preseed. | Even though I disabled DHCP in Preseed and configured a static IP address, my VM automatically assigned an IP address via DHCP every time. This caused me to have trouble accessing it from Ansible. | I solved the problem by assigning an IP address with `extra-args` in the virtual machine properties in the `auto_debian_insall.sh` file. This allowed me to set my IP address to `dot.10`. | ✅ | 04.07.2025 |
|2|`GRUB` operating system detection error | When I installed GRUB via my preseed file, it only identified the Debian operating system and automatically booted from the Debian operating system before the selection screen appeared. | In my preseed file, I prevented Debian from automatically booting by setting the `only_debian boolean` value to false in the grub configuration. I also enabled it to detect other operating systems by setting the `with_other_os` boolean value to true. This way, it automatically detects other operating systems at every startup and doesn't boot directly from Debian. | ✅ | 04.07.2025 |
|3| When I type `vagrant destroy`, the default network is deleted. | When I automatically pull the default network from the system and then type `vagrant destroy -f`, it removes the default network configuration from the system. | As a solution, I created a `before up` trigger and made the default network undeletable with the `chattr +i` command in this trigger. | ✅ | 14.07.2025 |
